The [Pushover service](https://pushover.net/) is a platform for the notify component. This allows components to send messages to the user using Pushover.

In order to get an API key you need to go to the [Pushover website](https://pushover.net) and register a new application. From the website you can also retrieve your user key.

To use Pushover notifications, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: pushover
    api_key: ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ
    user_key: ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `notify`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- **api_key** (*Required*): Your API key.
- **user_key** (*Required*): Your user key for Pushover.

Example Automation:
```yaml
- service: notify.entity_id
      data: 
        message: "This is the message"
        title: "Title of message"
        sound: pianobar
        priority: 0
```

This is a quote from the Pushover website regarding free/open source apps:

<blockquote>
  If you are creating a client-side library, application, or open source project that will be redistributed and installed by end-users, you may want to require each of your users to register their own application rather than including your own API token with the software.
</blockquote>

When setting up the application you can use this [icon](https://home-assistant.io/images/favicon-192x192.png).

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).

When sending a notification, optional parameters can also be set as per the pushover [API documentation](https://pushover.net/api). 

Example notification triggered from the Alexa component for an intents is shown below which also uses [Automation Templating](/getting-started/automation-templating/) for the message:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entries
alexa:
  intents:
    LocateIntent:
      action:
        service: notify.notify
        data_template:
          message: "The location of {% raw %}{{ User }}{% endraw %} has been queried via Alexa."
          data:
            title: "Home Assistant"
            sound: falling
            device: pixel
            url: "https://home-assistant.io/"
```
