[Wink](http://www.wink.com/) is a home automation hub that can control a whole wide range of devices on the market. Or, as they say in their own words:

<blockquote>
  Wink offers one, quick and simple way to connect people with the products they rely on every day in their home.
</blockquote>

Home Assistant integrates with the Wink API and automatically sets up any switches, lights, locks, fans, climate devices, covers, sensors, and alarms.

Check the related components pages for actual devices that are supported.

Home Assistant offers multiple ways to authenticate to the Wink API. Each authentication method is described below.

### Authenticate using [developer.wink.com](https://developer.wink.com)


This method will require you to setup a developer account with Wink. This process can take a few days to get approved but is the recommended form of authentication. If you would like to use Wink in Home Assistant while you wait, you can use the email and password authentication below.

This form of authentication doesn't require any settings in the configuration.yaml other than `wink:` this is because you will be guided through setup via the configurator on the frontend.

<p class='note'>
When using the configurator make sure the initial setup is performed on the same local network as the Home Assistant server, if not from the same box Home Assistant is running on. This will allow for authentication redirects to happen correctly. 
</p>

```yaml
wink:
```


### Authentication with your Wink email and password.


This method pulls a new token on every startup of Home Assistant from this [URL](https://winkbearertoken.appspot.com)

```yaml
wink:
  email: YOUR_WINK_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_WINK_PASSWORD
```

### Full oauth authentication (legacy).

This should be used for users that obtained their client_id and client_secret via email from Wink support.


```yaml
wink:
  email: YOUR_WINK_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_WINK_PASSWORD
  client_id: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Configuration variables:

- **email** (*Required for email/password auth or legacy OAuth*): Your Wink login email.
- **password** (*Required for email/password auth or legacy OAuth*): Your Wink login password.
- **client_id** (*Required for legacy OAuth*): Your provided Wink client_id.
- **client_secret** (*Required for legacy OAuth*): Your provided Wink client_secret.
- **local_control** (*Optional*): If set to `True` state changes for lights, locks, and switches will be an issue to the local hub.

Local control:
- Wink's local control API isn't officially documented and therefore could be broken by a hub update. For these reasons `local_control` defaults to `False`.

- Using local control doesn't appear to make commands any quicker, but does function in an internet/Wink outage.

- Local control is also only available for the Wink hub v1 and v2, not the Wink relay. 

- Local control isn't used during start-up of Home Assistant; this means initial setup requires an active internet connection.

- Local control requests are first sent to the controlling hub. If a request fails, that request will attempt to go online.

<p class='note'>
It is possible for the hub to get into a bad state where it stops accepting local control request. If this happens, you will notice requests taking significantly longer as they are redirected online. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it appears to be resolved by rebooting the hub.

The following error will be logged if the hub is rejecting local requests.

```
Error sending local control request. Sending request online
```

### {% linkable_title Service `refresh_state_from_wink` %}

The Wink component only obtains the device states from the Wink API once, during startup. All updates after that are pushed via a third party called PubNub. On rare occasions where an update isn't pushed device states can be out of sync. 

You can use the service wink/refresh_state_from_wink to pull the most recent state from the Wink API for all devices. If `local_control` is set to `True` states will be pulled from the devices controlling hub, not the online API.

### {% linkable_title Service `add_new_devices` %}

You can use the service wink/add_new_devices to pull any newly paired Wink devices to an already running instance of Home-Assistant. Any new devices will also be added if Home-Assistant is restarted.

<p class='note'>
The Wink hub, by default, can only be accessed via the cloud. This means it requires an active internet connection and you will experience delays when controlling and updating devices (~3s).
