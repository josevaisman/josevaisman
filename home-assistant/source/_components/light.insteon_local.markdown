The `insteon_local` light component lets you control your lights connected to an [Insteon Hub](http://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub/) with Home Assistant.

To integrate add a light, configure your hub Insteon(local) with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml platform entry
insteon_local:
  host: YOUR HUB IP
  username: YOUR HUB USERNAME
  password: YOUR HUB PASSWORD
  timeout: 10
  port: 25105
```

To add lights (dimmers) to your set-up, add the platform to your light configuration:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: insteon_local
```
