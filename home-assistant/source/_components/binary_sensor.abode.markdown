The `abode` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Abode](https://goabode.com/) alarms.

This component will automatically add `Door Contact` and `Motion Camera` binary sensors that are configured in your Abode account.

The requirement is that you have setup your [Abode hub](/components/abode/).
